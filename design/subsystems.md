# Subsystems

Subsystems are subsystems of a ship which perform a single common task. Subsystems are generalized and never duplicated. This means that for example you can have a weapons subsystem which controls multiple individual weapons.

## Current subsystems

See below for a list of current subsystem designs

### Fueltanks

Fueltanks are tanks used to store fuel. Fuel is used for hyperdrive shunts; not for generic inter-system travel.
